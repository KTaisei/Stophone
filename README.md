# stophone

This application was created to prevent people from using their smartphones while walking.
### Still in development and not perfect code.

## system

I am creating a program that uses the smartphone's acceleration sensor in the background, performs calculations, and displays the screen. When the app detects that you are walking at a speed of 3-5km/h, the app will launch and display the message "Don't use phone."
